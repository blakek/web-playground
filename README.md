# web-playground

> Quickly prototype your scripts, styles, etc. without worrying about setup

Yet another React, webpack, PostCSS starter repository you can use to play and plan.  Just make a couple components and test your ideas.

## Usage

Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

Just want to test a script?  Write it (or import it) in `src/index.js`:

```js

```

This will output

```
hello warld
```

Like what you made?  There's a script to minify/optimize everything and place it in `dist/`:

```
npm run build
```

## API



## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```
$ npm install web-playground
```
